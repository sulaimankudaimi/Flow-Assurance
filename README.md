# 🛡️ AI-Powered Flow Assurance & Scale Predictor

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a specialized engineering tool designed to predict **Flow Assurance** issues (Scale, Wax, and Asphaltene deposition) in oil wells. Using real-world data from the **Equinor Volve Field (Well F-9A)**, the tool identifies critical cooling zones and provides automated maintenance recommendations.

## 🛠️ Key Capabilities
- **Thermal Gradient Analysis:** Maps temperature vs. depth to identify deposition envelopes.
- **Automated Risk Reporting:** Generates technical reports identifying the "Danger Zone" in meters.
- **Smart Recommendations:** Suggests optimal chemical injection depths to prevent blockages.
- **Data-Driven:** Built on 38MB of authentic North Sea production data.

## 📊 Impact
By predicting blockages before they occur, this tool helps operators avoid costly workover operations, potentially saving up to **$500k per well intervention**.

## 👨‍🔬 Technical Stack
- **Data Source:** Equinor Volve Data (Kagglehub)
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Streamlit
